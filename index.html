🔄 REPRODUCTION STEPS:
1. Deploy to production (Kubernetes cluster)
2. Handle ~100 concurrent users
3. Memory steadily increases over time
4. Container killed after 6-8 hours

📈 METRICS & MONITORING:

- Memory after 1 hour: 400MB  
- Memory after 3 hours: 1.2GB
- Memory after 6 hours: 2GB+ → OOMKilled
- CPU usage remains stable ~15%
